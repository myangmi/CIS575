# Problem 4
# Run your Insertion Sort algorithm on 6 test sets: Pseudo-Random input and Almost Ordered input, each of size 100, of size 1,000, and of size 10,000. Report the running times (the number ofswaps).
n = 100
Pseudo-Random Swaps: 2329
Almost-Ordered Swaps: 159

n = 1000
Pseudo-Random Swaps: 228229
Almost-Ordered Swaps: 1887

n = 10000
Pseudo-Random Swaps: 23079229
Almost-Ordered Swaps: 19203
